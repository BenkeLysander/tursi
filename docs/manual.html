      <h2>tm File Format</h2>
      <p>
        A tm-file is a plain text file.
        It describes a turing machine by a transition table and commands.
      </p><p>
        tm-files are roughly processed line by line. Except for some commands,
        the order of these lines does not matter. Lines that contain only
        whitespace are ignored.
      </p><p>
        tm-files are case-sensitive.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Special characters</h3>
      <p>
        Whitespace (spaces and tabs) is used to separate words and cannot be used
        in any other way.
      </p><p>
        <u>#</u> is a special character (see comments and commands). It can be
        escaped using the same symbol again (<u>##</u>).
      </p><p>
        <u>!</u> can be used as a normal symbol, as long as it doesn't come
        after an unescaped <u>#</u>.
      <p>

      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>
        A comment starts with a <u>#</u> not directly followed by a <u>!</u> or
        a further <u>#</u>. It ends at the end of a line.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Commands</h3>
      <p>
        A command starts with <u>#!</u> and ends at the next command, comment
        or at the end of a line.
      </p><p>
        The first word of a command is its name. The following words are passed
        to this command as arguments.
      </p><p>
        All commands are executed in the order from the file (left to right, top
        to bottom).
      </p><p>
        There are six commands:

      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>
        A line that contains something, that isn't whitespace, part of a
        command or command is interpreted as a rule. 
      </p><p>
        A rule is part of the transition function/table.
        It is a tuple of the form <i>(state, read, write, move, next state)</i>.
        All fields are separated by whitespace.
      </p>
      <table class="manualBig">
        <tr>

      </table>
      <p>
        All input pairs must be unique.
      </p><p>
        In every step, the turing machine searches the table for a input
        that matches its current state and symbol under the header.
        When found, the three remaining fields (output) are applied in the
        following order: The current cell is overwritten with <i>write</i>,
        the header moves <i>move</i> cells to the right (this means, negative
        numbers move it to the left), the machine changes it state to
        <i>next&nbsp;state</i>.

      <h3>[A] Tape Viewer</h3>
      <p>
        Shows the tape of the turing machine.
      </p><p>
        Special cells are marked. These are the leftmost cell accessed by
        the header since the last tape reset (1), the cell where the header
        started (2), the current position of the header (3) and the rightmost
        cell (4).<br>
        Move the mouse over a cell to show its number.
      </p><p>
        Scroll the tape manually using the mouse wheel or simply click and drag
        the tape.<br>
        The viewer also offers different scroll modes, which can follow the
        header as it moves:

      </table>
      
      <h3>[B] Rule Table</h3>
      <p>
        These are the rules, that where loaded from the last successfully opened
        tm-file. They always have the order from the file.
      </p><p>
        States can be marked (see 'View' in the menu).
        The start state (<img src="img/icons/mark_start.png" alt="mark start">),
        the break states (<img src="img/icons/mark_break.png" alt="mark break">)
        and the end states (<img src="img/icons/mark_end.png" alt="mark end">)
        use icons as marks.
        All rules for the current state are marked with a other background color.
      </p><p>
        If a wildcard was defined, it is shown at the top.
      </p>

      <h3>[C] History</h3>
      <p>
        If a rule was executed, it is written to the end of the history.
        The number of that step is also stored (first column).
      </p><p>
        Before a rule is written to the history, wildcards are replaced with
        the actual read or written symbol.
      </p><p>
        The history is limited to a fix maximum of steps (see preferences).
        The oldest steps are discarded, if the maximum is exceeded. In
        that case, a hint is shown on the top.
      </p><p>
        [<img src="img/icons/clear_history.png" alt="clear history">]
        clears the history.
      </p>

      <h3>[D] Statistics</h3>
      <p>
        These are some statistics. They reset with certain manual changes (e.g.
        writing something onto the tape, changing the current state and so on).
      </p><p>
        All cell statistics (like the leftmost cell) can be clicked to scroll
        to the according cell.<br>
        That's the reason why there is the statistic <i>initial cell</i>, which
        will always be 0.
      </p>

      <h3>[E] Turing Machine Control Panel</h3>
      <p>
        This is the most important control panel. It lets you execute your turing
        machine.

        The speed of automatic execution can be set with the slider (5).

        On some systems a number is shown on the slider.
        This is not the pause time! The real pause time is shown in a tooltip.

      </p><p>
        Below, you can change the current state and position of the header.<br>
        The list of possible states is generated from the loaded tm-file.
        All states from the transition table and from the commands
        <u>start</u>, <u>break</u> and <u>end</u> are included.

            negative numbers.

      <h2>Export Filters</h2>
      <p>
        There are three export filters under 'File/Export/...'.
      </p>

      <h3>Tape</h3>
      <p>
        Export a section of the tape to a plain text file (txt).
      </p><p>
        The content of the text file is equal to the output of the console.
        Only the leading tabs are missing and you can choose, which section
        should be displayed.
      </p>

      <h3>State Diagram</h3>
      <p>
        Export the transition table as a state diagram in
        graph modelling language (gml).
      </p><p>
        A state diagram is a graph. Each state is a vertex (also called node).
        The vertices are connected with edges (also called arrows), where one
        edge is a rule.<br>
        The edges point from <i>state</i> to <i>next&nbsp;state</i>.
        They are labeled with the remaining fields <i>read</i>, <i>write</i>
        and <i>move</i> in this order.
      </p><p>
        No graphical informations (like the position or size of the vertices)
        are generated.
      </p><p>
        The start state, break states and end states are written into an extra
        tag '<u>Tursi</u>', which is not interpreted by other programs.<br>
        In fact it isn't interpreted at all, because Tursi can't load gml files.
        However, it would be possible to write an import function for such
        files.
      </p>
      
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Export the history as tab-separated values (tsv).
      </p><p>
        These are exactly the steps from the history table of the GUI, including
        the additional <i>step&nbsp;number</i> column.
      </p>

      <h2>Console Mode</h2>
      <p>
        These are the possible parameters for Tursi:
      </p><p class="code">
        java -jar tursi.jar [&lt;tm-file&gt;]
      </p><p>
        Start Tursi with a GUI. If a file is specified, it is loaded.
      </p><p class="code">
        java -jar tursi.jar -?
      </p><p>
        Print a short help.
      </p><p class="code">
        java -jar tursi.jar
        &lt;tm-file&gt; -c [&lt;groups&gt;=&lt;options&gt; [...]]
      </p><p>
        Open Tursi in console mode. The specified file is loaded and executed
        once. The parameters after <u>-c</u> are used to modify the output.
      </p><p>
        Print options can be applied to one ore more groups from

      <table class="manualBig">

      </table>
      <p>
        If a state is part of more than one group, the group rank decides, which
        options are applied. Groups with higher ranks override other groups.
        * means, that the options are combined with a logical OR.
      </p><p>
        If the same group is used multiple times with different options, only
        the last applied options are used.

            The printed tape section goes from the leftmost cell ever reached
            by the header to the rightmost cell.<br>
            The output is splitted into 3 lines. A short information about
            the printed tape section, negative cells (left part, seen from
            cell 0) and non-negative cells (right part), including cell 0.
            <br>
            If the tape contained 'xyzabcdefgh' and the header was at cell 4,
            the following lines would be printed:

            Print the next executed rule
            (only if a rule is executed after this step).<br>
            The output is the rule with a leading tab and tab-separated fields:
